/**
 * Sets up a function or an asynchronous task whose execution can be triggered
 * after a defined delay.  Multiple attempts to run the task before the delay
 * has passed are coalesced.  The task cannot be re-entered while running, but
 * can be executed again after a previous run finished.
 *
 * A common use case occurs when a data structure should be saved into a file
 * every time the data changes, using asynchronous calls, and multiple changes
 * to the data may happen within a short time:
 *
 *   let saveDeferredTask = new DeferredTask(async function() {
 *     await OS.File.writeAtomic(...);
 *     // Any uncaught exception will be reported.
 *   }, 2000);
 *
 *   // The task is ready, but will not be executed until requested.
 *
 * The "arm" method can be used to start the internal timer that will result in
 * the eventual execution of the task.  Multiple attempts to arm the timer don't
 * introduce further delays:
 *
 *   saveDeferredTask.arm();
 *
 *   // The task will be executed in 2 seconds from now.
 *
 *   await waitOneSecond();
 *   saveDeferredTask.arm();
 *
 *   // The task will be executed in 1 second from now.
 *
 * The timer can be disarmed to reset the delay, or just to cancel execution:
 *
 *   saveDeferredTask.disarm();
 *   saveDeferredTask.arm();
 *
 *   // The task will be executed in 2 seconds from now.
 *
 * When the internal timer fires and the execution of the task starts, the task
 * cannot be canceled anymore.  It is however possible to arm the timer again
 * during the execution of the task, in which case the task will need to finish
 * before the timer is started again, thus guaranteeing a time of inactivity
 * between executions that is at least equal to the provided delay.
 *
 * The "finalize" method can be used to ensure that the task terminates
 * properly.  The promise it returns is resolved only after the last execution
 * of the task is finished.  To guarantee that the task is executed for the
 * last time, the method prevents any attempt to arm the timer again.
 *
 * If the timer is already armed when the "finalize" method is called, then the
 * task is executed immediately.  If the task was already running at this point,
 * then one last execution from start to finish will happen again, immediately
 * after the current execution terminates.  If the timer is not armed, the
 * "finalize" method only ensures that any running task terminates.
 *
 * For example, during shutdown, you may want to ensure that any pending write
 * is processed, using the latest version of the data if the timer is armed:
 *
 *   AsyncShutdown.profileBeforeChange.addBlocker(
 *     "Example service: shutting down",
 *     () => saveDeferredTask.finalize()
 *   );
 *
 * Instead, if you are going to delete the saved data from disk anyways, you
 * might as well prevent any pending write from starting, while still ensuring
 * that any write that is currently in progress terminates, so that the file is
 * not in use anymore:
 *
 *   saveDeferredTask.disarm();
 *   saveDeferredTask.finalize().then(() => OS.File.remove(...))
 *                              .then(null, Components.utils.reportError);
