# Standalone binary
To debug or test behavior with real files, there is an `analyze-minidump` example which allows you to
see the minidump-analyzer output of a minidump passed on the command line (run with e.g. `cargo run
--example analyze-minidump <mindiump>`).

The `Cargo.lock` in this directory corresponds to this configuration.
