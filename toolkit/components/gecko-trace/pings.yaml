  reasons:
    idle: |
      Sent when the user has been idle for a configured period, allowing
      trace data collection to be transmitted during periods of low activity.
    buffer_full: |
      Sent when the internal trace buffer has reached its capacity limit and
      needs to be flushed to prevent data loss.
    shutdown: |
      Sent during Firefox shutdown to capture any remaining trace data before
      the browser exits.
