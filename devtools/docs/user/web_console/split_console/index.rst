Split console
=============

You can use the console alongside other tools. While you're in another tool in the Toolbox, just press :kbd:`Esc` or select the "Show split console" command in the :ref:`Toolbar <tools-toolbox-toolbar>` menu. The toolbox will now appear split, with the original tool above and the web console underneath.

You can close the split console by pressing :kbd:`Esc` again, or by selecting the "Hide split console" menu command.

As usual, ``$0`` works as a shorthand for the element currently selected in the Inspector:

When you use the split console with the debugger, the console's scope is the currently executing stack frame. So if you hit a breakpoint in a function, the scope will be the function's scope. You'll get autocomplete for objects defined in the function, and can easily modify them on the fly:

Note that you also can disable the split console altogether, open settings in the :ref:`Toolbar <tools-toolbox-toolbar>` menu, and uncheck Enable Split Console under Web Console
