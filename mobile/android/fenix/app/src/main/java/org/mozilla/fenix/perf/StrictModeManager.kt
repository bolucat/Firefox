 * Manages strict mode settings for the application.

 * them to your attention so you can fix them.
 *
 * It allows for defining custom thread and VM policies, applying them, and
 * managing suppressions of StrictMode violations with logging and tracking.
 *
 * @param isEnabledByBuildConfig A boolean indicating if StrictMode should be enabled
 *                                based on the application's build configuration.
 * @param components An instance of [Components] used to access core application features like the profiler.
 *                   Ideally, a more specific dependency would be injected, but this is used to
 *                   work around a circular dependency where StrictMode is part of Core,
 *                   and Core would need to be passed in here.
 * @param buildManufacturerChecker An instance of [ManufacturerChecker] used to
 *                                 apply manufacturer-specific StrictMode workarounds.
